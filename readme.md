## Introduction
Wireless communication networks have become an essential part of people's daily life starting from their mobile phones to home WiFi. Mobile phones are not just connecting people to their friends or sailing them to the virtual world, however, they have become an essential platform providing too many services that are related to government, health, business, banking, industrial, education, and safety applications.  The recent advanced development of wireless networks has opened even much more new essential applications such as in smart cities, the emerging IoT, industry era-4, autonomous vehicles,  smart grids, security and safety, and countless other applications. I can say that there is almost no branch in life today that was not or will not be affected or influenced by wireless communications.  Therefore, adequate knowledge about modern wireless communication becomes necessary for successful workers and project managers in ICT companies, industries, and businesses. However, the area of wireless communication is huge, it includes signals, systems, antennas, propagation, channels, networking, protocols, hardware, software, coding, cybersecurity, etc. Usually one needs to study for at least 4 years to gather a full but still basic knowledge of telecommunication. Hence, the challenge was how to present good and wide topics in wireless communication that should be useful for technical students as well as those professionals and even for those who had not studied telecommunication as a major topic before.
